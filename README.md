**Stellar Marketplace AI** ‚Äî A decentralized marketplace with AI-powered assistance and on-chain payments via the Stellar blockchain.

 Project Description

Stellar Marketplace AI is a decentralized web marketplace that lets users connect their Stellar wallets (Freighter or xBull), browse products, post their own listings, and purchase securely using XLM on the Stellar Testnet.

Beyond just product sales, this platform expands into a service and automation economy ‚Äî empowering creators, developers, and AI enthusiasts to share, sell, and collaborate through Web3.

The app includes:

An AI-powered assistant (‚ÄúStella‚Äù) that helps users with marketplace navigation, wallet setup, and product creation.

A Seller Page where users can list physical or digital products, showcase their skills, and use the built-in AI description generator to automatically create polished listings.

A Workflow Exchange Page where users can post n8n workflows they‚Äôre looking for, offer automation jobs, or request custom AI agents trained for specific tasks.

Full on-chain payment processing using the Stellar blockchain, ensuring fast, transparent, and low-cost transactions.

This project shows how AI, automation, and blockchain can merge to create a smart decentralized work and commerce ecosystem.
